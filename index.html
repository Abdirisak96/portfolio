                <p> Hello my name is Abdirisak Mohamed and i am a 25 year old Economic graduate who lives in Manchester and is an avid supporter of Manchester united.</p>
                <p> I first got into coding through speaking to a friend whilst exploring other avenues to make myself more employable and came across software engineering and saw that it was a new industry which was growing and saw a lot of opportunities to grow and develop.</p>
