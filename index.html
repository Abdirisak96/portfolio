                <img src="images/jpg" alt="">
                <p> Hello my name is Abdirisak Mohamed and i am a 25 year old Economic graduate who lives in Manchester.I am a avid supporter of Manchester united, what i enjoy in my spare time is long distance running and going for long walks around the city whilst listening to music.</p>
                <p> I first got into coding through speaking to a friend whilst exploring other avenues to make myself more employable, and came across software engineering and saw that it was a new industry which was growing and saw a lot of opportunities to grow and develop.During my research i saw how practical and useful it could be not just professionally but personally. I also saw a career which provided me with a challenge with an endless celling incomparison to other careers and saw that i could monitor my improvements visually and see how i have progressed.</p>
